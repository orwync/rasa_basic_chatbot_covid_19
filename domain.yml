  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are large group of viruses that cause illness in humans and
      animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then
      spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS. Although most
      human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades,
      with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person.
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Current evidence on other coronavirus strains shows that while coronaviruses
      appear to be stable at low and freezing temperatures for a certain period, food
      hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through
      food.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS,
      including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective
      measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way
      to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By
      doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection
      that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: COVID-19 is often more severe in people 60+yrs or with health conditions
      like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune
      system.â€‹
